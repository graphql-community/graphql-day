,,,Jonathan Rainer,,,,,jonathan@jonathan-rainer.com,,,,"GraphOps: Bringing DevOps to GraphQL with the Apollo GraphOS Operator
","GraphQL Federation, having multiple GraphQL services accessible via a single endpoint, is transformative for enterprises. Modular schema, decoupled deployments, and a clear ownership model can accelerate delivery by orders of magnitude. However, rolling out Federated GraphQL at scale comes with its own challenges, such as how to make deployments safe.

This talk will discuss the Apollo GraphOS Kubernetes Operator, a Kubernetes-native way for enterprises to manage GraphQL and Federation.  It will start with general Operator design principles and discuss how these principles were applied to the  Operator, so that it can address many different deployment strategiesuse-cases deployment architectures with multiple CustomResources. Attendees will also see how the Operator can perform safe deployments of GraphQL schema even in the face of a rollback. 

In this talk, attendees will learn how combining GraphQL and DevOps can unlock the benefits of both approaches, all powered by the Apollo GraphOS Kubernetes Operator.","I'm Jonathan Rainer and I've worked at several companies since joining the industry in 2019. I started working on High Performance Java at Anaplan, before moving to designing Rust Operators in Kubernetes to power Anaplan's Full Model Load Tool. I then moved to Monzo where I worked on their Data Engineering team and joined Apollo GraphQL in 2024 where I've been developing the Apollo GraphOS Operator and working on the Rover CLI. 

In my spare time I'm a keen runner and plan on entering a half marathon soon as well as being a podcast host of Look Into My Eyes, a podcast that analyses the Demon Headmaster series of children's books and TV adaptations. "
,,,Nithin Kumar B,,,,,nithin@wundergraph.com,,,,Introducing Fission: The Intent-first Approach to Schema Design and Microservice Governance,"In today's complex microservice architectures, building cohesive APIs often feels like assembling a puzzle without seeing the complete picture. Traditional bottom-up approaches lead to fragmented schemas and governance challenges. This talk introduces Fission, a paradigm-shifting methodology that flips GraphQL Federation on its head.

Rather than building individual service schemas in isolation, Fission employs an intent-first approach where teams collaboratively design the ideal schema based on concrete use cases. This top-down methodology enables developers to create APIs that truly reflect business requirements while maintaining clean service boundaries.

We'll demonstrate how Fission abstracts away the complexities of federation, facilitates real-time schema collaboration, and introduces a governance model that evolves naturally with your architecture. Join us to discover how you can design like a monolith while implementing in a microservice architecture, all without sacrificing developer autonomy or API coherence.","Hi, I’m Nithin, a Founding Engineer at WunderGraph.

YES,,,Matthias Le Brun,,,,,bloodyowl@icloud.com,,,,"GraphQL, Pothos & SQLite: a perfect match",we'll explore how GraphQL and SQLite give us a strong foundation for building production applications that are performant while addressing most of the usual GraphQL hiccups. we'll also dive on dramatically improving the DX of building a GraphQL server using Pothos. ,"frontend engineer, ai hater, chief shitpost officer"
YES,,,Alessandro Pagnin,,,,,ale@wundergraph.com,,,,An Eventful Journey: Building Federated GraphQL Subscriptions,"Real-time APIs are powerful - but making them work across a federated GraphQL architecture can quickly become a tangle of duplicated logic, performance bottlenecks, and inconsistent data. In this talk, we'll share how we evolved our GraphQL Federation from per-service subscription handling to a model where the federation gateway connects directly to an event system. This shift simplified the whole architecture and unlocked new ways to deliver consistent, scalable real-time updates across distributed microservices.

You'll learn:

- How to design **federated subscriptions** that scale across services and teams
- Practical strategies for dealing with **eventual consistency** and data freshness
- Techniques to overcome **performance bottlenecks** like ""thundering herd""
- Advantages from running this architecture **in production at scale**

Whether you're designing your first federated GraphQL system or evolving one already in production, this session will help you rethink how event-driven patterns can make real-time APIs simpler, faster, and more resilient.","Alessandro is a passionate developer — curious, creative, and always evolving. At WunderGraph, he focuses on customer support and contributes to Cosmo Streams (aka Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions, EDFS)"
YES,,,Benjie Gillam,,,,,benjie@graphile.com,,,,Grafast: A Declarative Solution to GraphQL's Execution Woes,"Introducing Grafast: a new approach to GraphQL execution, enabling engineers to build next-level efficiency into new or existing GraphQL APIs. This declarative approach to execution eliminates the many pitfalls of traditional resolvers and optimizes communications with your business logic. This is achieved through understanding the request's full data requirements and planning the best batched execution strategy before requesting anything from the business logic. This decoupling of data fetching from the GraphQL request shape results in fewer and more efficient operations against your backend services and data sources, eliminating both over- and under-fetching on the backend along with deduplication of redundant work, leading to reduced operational costs and delightful user experiences! A passion project of a founding GraphQL TSC member, this MIT-licensed open source technology has already been in production at a number of companies for over a year!","A ""community-funded open source maintainer,"" Benjie dedicates much of his time to open source, made possible by sponsorship from appreciative and forward-thinking individuals and organizations. Often found helping contributors advance proposals and instrumental in many key GraphQL advancements and initiatives, Benjie is proud to help guide GraphQL into the future as a member of the Technical Steering Committee."
YES,,,Benjamin Coenen,,,,,benjamin.coenen@hotmail.com,,,,Unlocking Performance with Response Caching,"This talk reveals how unlocking cache benefits is now just a directive away: enable caching at the supergraph level, without touching your subgraph code. Take advantage of flexible surrogate cache keys for more granular invalidations, and enjoy instant improvements to performance and consistency across your federated graph without major architecture changes required.
Debugging and operations become a breeze with the new cache debugger right inside Apollo Sandbox, enabling clear insights into cache behavior and hit rates. Deepened observability is built in, with expanded metrics and distributed tracing so you can understand, optimize, and trust your caching layer. When it comes to invalidation, it supports more complex invalidation scenarios—ensuring your data is always fresh and reliable.
Learn how Apollo's latest caching rewrite offers a seamless path to higher performance, less backend load, and the observability teams need.","Staff Engineer working at Apollo GraphQL on the router mainly on topics like caching, telemetry, subscription and GraphQL execution.

YES,,,Aurélien David,,,,,spyl94@gmail.com,,,,Features You May Not Be Using (But Will Love),"We all know queries, mutations, and resolvers—but GraphQL has many other features. This session explores techniques you may not be using yet and will likely love once you do: directive‑driven concerns (auth, caching, validation) ; custom scalars that enforce domain rules at the schema edge; cursor‑based pagination that scales predictably; and thoughtful use of introspection. We’ll also cover designing stable, globally unique IDs that power robust cache keys.",Co-founder & CTO @Billy acquired by Pennylane - GraphQL teacher
YES,,,Vanessa Johnson,,,,,vmjohnson999@gmail.com,,,,What if Your API Spoke Accessibility?,"Accessibility is too often added late in the UI layer, leading to inconsistent user experiences. This talk shows how to embed accessibility metadata directly in GraphQL schemas so developers can deliver accessible defaults to Android, iOS, and web clients from day one.

YES,,,Ivan Goncharov,,,,,ivan.goncharov.ua@gmail.com,,,,Beyond SDL: Into the Wonderful World of Graphs,"GraphQL says “graph,” but SDL keeps us in text. 
In this talk, we step beyond SDL into the wonderful world of graphs. I will show how layout choices affect readability and we explore why hierarchical (Sugiyama-style) diagrams can beat force-directed “hairballs.”

Drawing on lessons from building GraphQL Voyager, I’ll share quick visual experiments and practical heuristics—simplifying connections, collapsing low-signal nodes, separating operation roots. I’ll also present emerging interactions for large, GitHub-scale schemas.

You’ll leave with a grounded view of the possibilities and limits of graph visualization, plus sneak peeks at new experiments I’m working on.",Ivan has been active in the GraphQL community since its early days and is currently a member of the GraphQL Technical Steering Committee.
